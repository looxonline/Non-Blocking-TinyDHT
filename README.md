# Non - Blocking version of the Adafruit TinyDHT Sensor Library

This is an non-blocking version of the Adafruit TinyDHT library. I needed a tiny library that would not hold up my processor. One did not exist so I wrote this one based on the existing tiny lib. It's very simple to use. Look at the provided example for the simplest use case. 

To download, click the DOWNLOADS button, rename the uncompressed folder NonBTinyDHT. Check that the NonBTinyDHT folder contains NonBTinyDHT.cpp, NonBTinyDHT.h, and an examples folder. Place the NonBTinyDHT library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if it is your first library. Restart the Arduino development software (IDE).
